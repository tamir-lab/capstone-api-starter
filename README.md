# Clothing Store

## Description of the Project

This project is a Spring Boot E-Commerce API developed for Capstone 3.
It serves as the backend for an online Clothing Store, allowing users to browse products, filter by category, manage a shopping cart, and place orders.

The API connects to a MySQL database and is consumed by an existing frontend web application. The primary goal of this project is to fix existing bugs, add new backend features, and ensure the API functions correctly through testing with Insomnia.

## User Stories

- As a shopper, I want to view all clothing products so that I can browse what the store offers.

- As a shopper, I want to filter products by category so that I can quickly find what I’m looking for.

- As a shopper, I want to add items to my cart so that I can purchase multiple products at once.

- As a shopper, I want to place an order so that I can complete my purchase.

- As a developer, I want the API to return clear error messages so that issues can be easily identified and fixed.
